# # implement a class called activity. each instance of this class has two attributes: start_time and end_time. both should be int numbers between 0 and 24.
# # then, implement a function for comparing two activities. the function should return True if the first activity ends before the second activity starts.
# # the fuction should also check that the activities are not overlapping.
# # finally, implement a class named set. each instance of this class has a list of activities.
# # the activities in the list should be sorted by their finish time and an activity can be added to the list if it starts after the first activity finshes
# # and finishes before the last activity starts. an activity can only be added if it does not overlap with any other activity in the list.
# # before adding an activiy, the list should be sorted by finish time.
