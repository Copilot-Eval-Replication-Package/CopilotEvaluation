# implement a class called activity_schedule.
# each instance of this class has two attributes: activities and schedule. activities is a list of activity objects. schedule is a list of lists.
# each sublist contains the activities that are scheduled for that time slot. activities are sorted by start time.
# implement a function called greedy_activity_selector that takes a list of activities and returns an activity_schedule object.
# the function should schedule the activities in the schedule list so that the total time between the start and end times of each activity is minimized.
# implement a function called activity_score that takes a list of activities and returns the score of the schedule.
# the score is the total time between the start and end times of each activity.
# implement a function called activity_score_comparison that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort that takes an activity_schedule object and returns a sorted list of activities.
# the sorted list should be sorted by the start time of each activity.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort_comparison that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort_comparison_2 that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort_comparison_3 that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort_comparison_4 that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
# implement a function called activity_schedule_sort_comparison_5 that takes two activity_schedule objects and returns True if the first activity_schedule has a higher score than the second.
