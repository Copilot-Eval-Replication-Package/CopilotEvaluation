=======

# if the two activities overlap, the function should return False.
# if the two activities donâ€™t overlap, the function should return True.

=======

# if the two activities are not overlapping, the function should return True.
# if the two activities are overlapping, the function should return False.
# the function should also check that the end time of the first activity is not greater than the start time of the second activity.
# if the end time of the first activity is greater than the start time of the second activity, the function should return False.
# the function should also check that the end time of the first activity is not greater than the end time of the second activity.
# if the end time of the first activity is greater than the end time of the second activity, the function should return False.
# if all of the above conditions are met, the function should return True.

=======

# the function should return False if the activities are not overlapping and the first activity ends after the second activity starts.

=======

# if the activities are overlapping or the first activity ends before the second activity starts, return False.

=======

# the function should also check that the activities are not equal.
# if all these conditions are met, the function should return True.
# otherwise, the function should return False.
