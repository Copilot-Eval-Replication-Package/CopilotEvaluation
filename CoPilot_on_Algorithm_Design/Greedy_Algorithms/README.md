This section contains the python file for greedy algorithms alngside the excel file which contains our tests and their results.<br>

__Points of consideration:__<br>
1. At the time of creation, we gave the Python file an unrelated name to make sure CoPilot is not finding out what the problem is from the script's name.<br>
We have changed the name once the tests were finished.

2. The script contain the solutions that were accepted as correct. If you're seeing multiple functions or functions as comments, they were CoPilot's direct output. However, since the code was correct, we accepted them. We have a discussion about this in our paper as well.

3. The snippent of code `if __name__ == "__main__":` and the flowwing code is ours and not generated by CoPilot. We used it for debugging purposes and to observe generated functions' functionality.
