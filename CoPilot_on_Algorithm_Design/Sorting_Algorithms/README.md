This section contains the python files for the sorting algorithms alngside the excel file which contains our tests and their results.<br>

__Points of consideration:__<br>
1. At the time of creation, for each Python file we gave it an unrelated name to make sure CoPilot is not finding out what the problem is from the script's name.<br>
We have changed the names once the tests were finished.

2. You may encounter some comments in the scripts which seem strange. In order to preserve CoPilot's outputs, we did not remove them. These comments were generated by CoPilot during code generation.

3. The scripts contain the solutions that were accepted as correct. If you're seeing multiple functions or functions as comments, they were CoPilot's direct output. However, since the code was correct, we accepted them. We have a discussion about this in our paper as well.

4. The snippent of code `if __name__ == "__main__":` and the flowing code is ours and not generated by CoPilot. We used it for debugging purposes and to observe generated functions' functionality.
